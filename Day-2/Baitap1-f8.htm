    <h1>Low and Slow</h1>
    <p>
      This week I am <i>extremely</i> excited about cooking technique called
      <i>sous vide.</i> In <i>sous vide.</i> cooking, you submerde the food(
      usually vaccuum sealed in plastic) into a water bath that is apresicele
      set to the target temperater you want the food to be cooked to. In to
      book, <i>Cooking fir Geeks,</i> Jeff Potter describes is as "ultra-low
      temperater poaching"

      Next month, we will be serving
      <strong>Sous Vide Salmon with Dill Hollandaise</strong>.To reserve a seat
      ar the chef table, contact us before November 30.
